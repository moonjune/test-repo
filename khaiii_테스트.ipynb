            "내용2:  ‘더미’은 프랑스 더미 철학을 더미하는 더미 중 하나이다. 그러나 여러 프랑스 철학자들의 더미 더미은 공통점과 차이점이 있음에도 아직 종합적으로 더미되지는 못하고 있다. 이 연구는 들뢰즈의 사건 더미, 더미뷁뷁의 사건 더미, 메더미-더미의 지각론과 예술론 등을 검토하면서, 사건 개념을 인간 인식 더미 및 예술과의 더미 하에서 재정립하도록 한다. 이를 통해 사건이란 곧 ‘일상적인 경험 더미 밖의 것들과 조우함으로써 인식 더미들의 확장을 불러오는 사태’이며, 예술의 소임은 더미을 발생시키는 것이라는 점이 밝혀질 것이다. 이 더미에서 본 더미는 지각과 더미의 일반적인 더미 및 더미 속에서 지각과 더미가 더미되는 메커니즘을 더미적으로 고찰해 볼 것이다. 또한 지각은 ‘기억’을 참조함으로써 더미되므로, 지각이 확장되는 더미을 고찰하기 위해 기억에 대한 심도 깊은 더미 역시 진행하도록 한다. 나아가 사건 속에서 우리가 감지하는 더미은 더미의 선형적 시간관을 파기하므로, ‘더미’에 대한 더미뷁을 시도할 것이다. 특히, 예술작품에서의 더미성 문제를 더미적으로 다루도록 한다.\n",
            "효과1:  1. ‘사건’을 토대로 ‘지각, 기억, 사유’를 상관적으로 검토하면서 그것들의 가장 근원적인 역량을 밝혀, 인간에 대한 근본적인 이해의 틀 및 바람직한 삶의 태도에 관한 실천적인 지침을 제시한다.2. 사건 속에서 인식 능력들이 연쇄적으로 확장될 때 우리가 체험하는 시간은 일상에서의 시간과는 다르게 흐르므로, 사건에 대한 논의는 ‘시간에 대한 재해석’을 요구한다. 특히, 사건 개념은 과거와 현재 그리고 미래가 직선적으로 이어진다고 보는 전통적인 시간관을 재검토할 것을 촉구한다. 더불어, 사건 개념은 ‘예술작품에서의 시간성’에 대한 실마리 역시 제공한다. 3. 사건 개념은 감상자에게 불러 올 감각의 확장과 사유의 확장이라는 반응을 중심으로 예술작품을 판단하는 새로운 예술 비평의 틀을 구축하도록 이끈다. 혹은 작품-예술가-감상자라는 구도에서 세 요소가 각기 환원 불가능한 항으로서 중시되는 예술 비평의 기조를 마련하도록 만든다.\n",
